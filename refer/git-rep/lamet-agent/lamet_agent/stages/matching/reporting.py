"""Markdown reporting helpers for the perturbative-matching stage.

The organizing rule: **nothing here is hardcoded to one kernel**. The same report
serves a Coulomb-gauge quark PDF and a gauge-invariant meson DA, which differ in
their factorization, their notation, and their source paper -- so every statement is
derived from the ``kernel_id`` the manifest chose, and the numbers themselves always
come from ``kernels.py`` alone (nothing here can change a result).

The functions fall into five groups:

1. Reading the kernel_id. ``_split_kernel_id`` breaks
   ``<gauge>_<operator>_<distribution>_<scheme>_<order>`` into its fields;
   ``_parse_kernel_id`` is the common two-field view; ``is_da_kernel`` and
   ``_kernel_description`` answer "what is this kernel?" from those fields plus the
   OPERATOR_TEXT / DISTRIBUTION_TEXT / PDF_POLARIZATION_TEXT tables at the top. Add a
   kernel with a new operator or distribution and those tables want a new row.

2. Reading the kernel's provenance. ``_kernel_reference`` returns the paper and
   equations the kernel function tags itself with (``@kernel_reference`` in
   kernels.py), so citations follow the kernel rather than a table kept in sync here.

3. The static tables: ``_settings_table``, ``_field_definitions``,
   ``_scheme_explanation``, ``_diagnostics``, ``_figure_block``, ``_outputs_table``.
   Plain formatting of the job record the stage produced.

4. The formula section -- the only part that calls an LLM. ``_kernel_source`` collects
   the kernel and everything it actually calls (following the call graph, so a DA
   kernel gets its ``V(x, y)`` and a PDF kernel its ``C(ksi)``); ``_fetch_paper_text``
   pulls the LaTeX of the tagged arXiv paper; ``_formula_prompt`` asks the model to
   write the closed form *and* cross-check code against paper; ``_llm_kernel_formula``
   makes the call and caches it; ``_matching_formula_text`` wraps that in the
   factorization. The factorization is NOT branched on here: ``_kernel_structure`` reads
   the ``matching_structure`` the kernel declares in ``kernels.py`` (its display equation,
   its notation guidance, and any all-orders resummation), and both the prompt and the
   rendered factorization follow it -- so a DA kernel, a PDF kernel, or a renormalon-resummed
   kernel each render themselves with no ``if is_da``/``if is_lrr`` in this module, and a new
   kernel needs no change here. Division of labour: the code is authoritative for WHICH
   terms exist, the paper for how they are WRITTEN, and the cross-check reports where the
   two disagree. ``FormulaLlm`` carries the run's LLM config down from the CLI; this section
   raises rather than invent a formula offline.

5. Assembly and writing: ``build_matching_report_markdown`` orders the sections,
   ``write_matching_report`` writes one job's file, and ``write_matching_stage_report``
   writes the one report per stage that the runner actually calls.

# --- LLM-derived kernel formula --------------------------------------------
# The whole section answers one question -- "what coefficient did this run apply?" --
# for whichever kernel_id the manifest named, and it splits that job three ways:
#
#   * the CODE decides WHICH terms exist. ``_kernel_source`` hands the model the kernel
#     function and everything it calls, and the prompt says the code is the single
#     source of truth for the terms: which logs, which branches, whether a delta term
#     is there, what the scheme correction is. No formula is hand-written here, so a
#     kernel and its report cannot drift apart.
#   * the PAPER decides HOW it is WRITTEN. ``_fetch_paper_text`` pulls the LaTeX of the
#     arXiv id the kernel tags itself with, and the prompt says the paper is the
#     authority for notation: xi = x/y versus V(x, y), the plus-prescription's bracket
#     structure, how the subtraction domain is marked.
#   * the CROSS-CHECK decides WHETHER THE TWO AGREE. The prompt requires a verdict
#     comparing code against paper term by term, listing every discrepancy. Handing
#     over both without demanding that verdict just lets the model quietly reconcile
#     them, and a mistranscribed kernel would read as agreement.
#
# Nothing in this section names a kernel or a paper. The manifest picks a kernel_id,
# the kernel carries its own @kernel_reference (arXiv id + equations), and
# _kernel_reference reads it back -- so a kernel from a new paper needs no change here.
# See kernels.py. Provider configs (base_url / default_model / key_env) come from
# ``core.llm.PROVIDERS`` so this module stays in sync with the rest of the agent.

# Generating a formula is a network round-trip; memoize so the per-job and the
# stage-level report reuse one call per kernel and language. The key is the kernel_id
# itself, not its parsed fields: CG_gt_quark_PDF_hybrid_NLO and GI_gt_quark_PDF_hybrid_NLO
# share an operator and a scheme but are different kernels from different papers, and
# keying on those fields would serve one of them the other's formula. The value is
# ``(markdown, paper_used)`` so the provenance note knows whether the paper text
# actually made it into the prompt.
