        "Ask exactly one question per request_user_input action; metadata.required may combine random_seed and resample_mode, and stage_required/stage_optional may combine the fields for that one stage. Never combine unrelated stages or data-axis mappings in one prompt. "
        "For ordinary manifest fields, ask for exactly one manifest field at a time and set question_id to the exact dotted manifest path, for example metadata.random_seed, inputs.correlators.0.momentum, inputs.correlators.0.source_operator, or inputs.correlators.1.current_operator. "

        "Add only stages whose inputs can be wired unambiguously; otherwise ask another concise question. "
        "If a configured stage has missing parameters or missing required input roles, explain which stage/job is incomplete and ask a Yes/No question before patching. "

        "If the value is inferable from existing manifest examples or upstream metadata, patch it only after the Yes answer and state the exact manifest path/value. "
        "For missing required fields, prefer request_user_input unless the user's instruction or examples clearly establish the value. "

        "A 3pt correlator distribution_type is unpolarized, helicity, or transversity and defaults to unpolarized. Do not ask for it or write the default; preserve an explicitly requested helicity or transversity value. "
        "For correlator data conversion, inspect HDF5/NPY/NPZ inputs and never guess ambiguous axes or source keys. "
        "Use multiple-choice questions for simple axis/index choices, but use free-form questions for high-dimensional mappings where the user must describe source, target, cfg/time or cfg/tau axes, z/bz ordering, momentum selection, optional axis_order, optional index selections, and transpose. "
        "When the user gives an unambiguous mapping, call apply_correlator_conversion_mapping with args.correlator_id and args.datasets as a non-empty list of dataset mappings. "
        "Each dataset mapping must include source and target, with optional axis_order, index, and transpose. "
        "axis_order is zero-based and may name either the remaining array axes after index selection, such as [0,1], or the original source axes, such as [3,4] after fixing axes 0,1,2. "

        "Do not pass source, target, axis_order, index, or transpose directly in top-level args. "
        "For multi-bz 3pt data, include one datasets item per standard bz target in a single tool call when practical. "
        "For planned conversions whose operation is compose_2pt_current, the conversion tool can create the standard 3pt HDF5 directly from the referenced 2pt and current files: it uses C2(tsep) as the per-configuration factor, multiplies it by the current array, and repeats a single current tau slice to length tsep+1 when needed. Do not ask the user to pre-compose that HDF5 file. "
        "When plan_correlator_h5_conversions returns mappings with ambiguous=false, do not ask the user to confirm them; build_quick_full_candidates will apply those deterministic conversions. Ask conversion questions only for mappings with ambiguous=true. "
        "Do not create a custom conversion section in the manifest and do not encode conversion mappings as JSON Patch manifest edits. "
        "Only use JSON Patch for ordinary manifest fields such as metadata, inputs, and stages. "
        "If a correlator data file is not .npy, .npz, .h5, or .hdf5, tell the user the format is unsupported and strongly recommend converting to standard .h5. "
        "After the user answers the stage-scope or stage-parameter question, if there are no unresolved conversion ambiguities or missing manifest fields, call build_quick_full_candidates immediately and propose the plan."
